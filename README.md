# AI-Powered-News-Aggregator
The AI-Powered News Aggregator is a Python-based application that fetches the latest news articles from various categories (e.g., technology, sports, business) using the NewsAPI. It analyzes the headlines to detect potentially misleading or sensational content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application classifies each article as "Reliable" or "Misleading" and displays the results in an easy-to-read format.

This project demonstrates the use of:

* NewsAPI for fetching real-time news data.

* TextBlob for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.

* Flask (for the web-based version) to create a user-friendly interface.
  
# Features
